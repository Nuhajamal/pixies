**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**  
This project integrates face recognition into a CCTV system for real-time monitoring and automated attendance tracking. It simplifies surveillance by identifying individuals in live video streams and logging their attendance efficiently.

**THE PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
Manually tracking attendance or identifying individuals from CCTV footage is tedious and error-prone, especially in large-scale setups.

**THE SOLUTION**  
By harnessing face recognition and computer vision, this system automates real-time identification and attendance logging. Itâ€™s fast, accurate, and ensures seamless monitoring.
